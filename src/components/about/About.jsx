                        Welcome to DomDevOps, my showcase as a Full Stack software engineer. My background is rich with
                        experience in financial analysis, business management, and now, software engineering. After a
                        rewarding decade working fiscal administration in the public sector, my knack for tackling
                        complex problems inspired me to earn a second Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Here,
                        youâ€™ll find projects that blend my technical skills with my strategic acumen as I navigate the
                        evolving tech landscape.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Though new to the field of software development, my portfolio already showcases a variety of
                        projects that highlight my proficiency in diverse programming languages and embrace DevOps
                        principles. I'm committed to continual learning and eager to apply innovative solutions in
                        software development. I look forward to collaborating within the tech community, embracing new
                        challenges, and contributing to impactful software projects.
